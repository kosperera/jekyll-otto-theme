[Speakerdeck.com](https://speakerdeck.com/) is a really simple site that lets you upload your presentation decks. Unlike other sites, Speakerdeck only supports PDF format and almost major presentation software can export your slides to a nice PDF. [Speakerdeck FAQ](https://speakerdeck.com/faq) is a good source of information to get started.

See how I embedded speaker decks [on my talks website repository](https://github.com/kosalanuwan/gh-site-talks) to learn more.
